# Working Groups

The primary work of SDDI is done within working groups. The current list of working groups can be found [here](https://github.com/sddiproject#working-groups).

## Forming a new Working Group

Any group can come forward with a proposal to form a new working group. The proposal must be shared on the [discussion list](https://lists.sddiproject.org/g/discuss), and should contain the following items:

- Purpose
- Goals
- Non-Goals
- Deliverables
- Resources

A template for the proposal can be found in the [wg-template repository](https://github.com/sddiproject/wg-template#readme).

Once shared with the discussion list, the working group proposal will be added to the agenda of the next available Steering Committee meeting for the prospective working group to present. Prospective Working Group presentation should include overview of charter elements, along with list of initial and prospective participants. The Steering Committee can approve during the meeting, or if needed postpone vote to next meeting or do an email vote.
Working Groups will participate in an Annual Review.

## Changing Working Group charter

Working Groups can come to Steering Committee at any time to propose changes to their charter. The Steering Committee must approve any charter changes.

## Annual Review

At the Steering Committee meeting closest to the anniversary of the working group being approved by the Steering Committee, the Working Group will be up for an Annual Review. The Annual Review presentation must include the following items:

- Brief overview of group
- Progress towards deliverables
- Adjustments to charter needed
- Feedback on working with SDDI

If the Working Group has completed all of it's deliverables, the Steering Committee may vote to move the Working Group to Emeritus status.

## Emeritus

Working Groups may propose to the Steering Committee to be moved to Emeritus status at any time if it has completed it's deliverables or if the Working Group has become inactive. It is recommended to form a new Working Group rather than revive an Emeritus status Working Group if there is a desire to revive the Working Group.
